When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  -When I want to have access to my repository from another computer or when I would like 
  to share with another person the same project. It is a easy way to get colaboration from my colleagues
  to improve my work as well.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  -Because I want to finish my changes first and push all when I think it is ready. If it was automatically could bring a lot of conflit to resolve while I was working on to finish the feature first.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  -Forks: To get a copy of a remote repository from GitHub (to your remote repository as well) that don't allows you to work on that.(Fork exist only on GitHub).
  -Clones: To get a copy of a repository from GitHub to my local computer, after that I can make changes and commits as contributor.
  -Branches: I use branches when I start working on an experimental feature for exemplo or to fix a bug withou chanch the branch Master. It is a copy inside my local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	-I can work offline, and I can compare changes made from remote repository with my local. It is easier to help to fix conflicts too.

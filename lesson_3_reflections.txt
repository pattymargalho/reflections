When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  -When I want to have access to my repository from another computer or when I would like 
  to share with another person the same project. It is a easy way to get colaboration from my colleagues
  to improve my work as well.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  -Because I want to finish my changes first and push all when I think it is ready. If it was automatically could bring a lot of conflit to resolve while I was working on to finish the feature first.
